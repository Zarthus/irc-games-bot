{"name":"IRC Games Bot","tagline":"The IRC bot hosting games on irc.esper.net#ircgames ","body":"IRC Games bot\r\n=============\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zarthus/irc-games-bot.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Zarthus/irc-games-bot)\r\n\r\nGamesBot is a modular IRC bot written on the Cinch IRC framework. GamesBot strives to host a large variety of enjoyable\r\nirc games together with your friends. It offers many helper functions to easily design new games, and is easily set up and installed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install you must first install the appropriate gems.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to do this is by running `bundle install` from the root of the directory.\r\n\r\nOnce the command has completed, copy `conf/config.example.yaml` to `conf/config.yaml` and start editing the file with your favourite text editor.\r\nMost of the options will be straightforward if you have experience with IRC. If an option confuses you, refer to [the docs](docs/configuration.md).\r\n\r\n## Running tests\r\n\r\nOnce installed and configured, execute `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests\r\n\r\n## Environments\r\n\r\nDifferent configuration files can be loaded by executing the file and passing the `env` argument.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n./bot.rb --env dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould attempt to load `conf/config.dev.yaml` rather than `conf/config.yaml`\r\n\r\nMake additional copies of your configuration if you plan to use different environments.\r\n\r\n## Running the bot\r\n\r\nThat's all that is necessary to set up the bot. You can now run it using `./bot.rb` or `ruby bot.rb`.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nPlease refer to [the documentation](docs) for more elaboration on certain functions.\r\n\r\nIf you need extra support, see [docs/support](docs/support.md).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe bot is licensed under the MIT license.
