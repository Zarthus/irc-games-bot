## New Pull Request

Submitting a patch? Great!

Here's a checklist of what we'll generally be looking for, if all items are crossed off, you're good to send in a PR:

- Are the changes following the style guide?
- Are all tests completing successfully?
- Are the commits descriptive of what was changed?
  - Are any useless commits properly rewritten?
- If applicable, do the commit messages include the ID of the issue?

Furthermore, we would appreciate if you named your branch accordingly to what the feature does. Example:

Bad: `patch-1`, `feature`, `change`, `fix`
Great: `feature/ignore-ctcp-flood`, `feature/voice-mechanism`, `fix/replay-tracking`, `game/super-mario-world`

### New Game

Making a new game and testing it can be time consuming, and hopefully we were able to provide the tools necessary for your game to shine.

If everything works as you'd like, and the Pull Request guidelines are met. Send in the pull request, write a small description of what your game is all about and fire off the pull request.

## Thanks!

Regardless of how you contribute, thanks for contributing!
