Vagrant
=======

If you're unfamiliar with Vagrant, [this will help you get started](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html).

## Setup

All you need to do is copy `Vagrantfile.example` to `Vagrantfile`. The configuration should be good to go - but if you'd like to make any adjustments, this is the file to do it in.
